# Some Comp-Ling / NLP courses offered at Potsdam

You can find an overview of the classes that we have offered [on our main website](http://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/teaching/). Some of the classes mentioned there have their own repositories or websites. This repo collects information about those that don't (i.e., where the other material only exists in our internal course management system).
